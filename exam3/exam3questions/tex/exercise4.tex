\begin{question}
From a very large population, a random sample of 550 individuals was
taken. In that sample, 20.5\% were asleep. Determine a 96\% confidence
interval of the population proportion.
\begin{answerlist}
  \item Find the lower bound of the confidence interval.
  \item Find the upper bound of the condifence interval.
\end{answerlist}
\end{question}

\begin{solution}
Determine \(z^\star\) such that \(P(|Z|<z^\star) = 0.96\).
\[z^\star = 2.05 \] Calculate the standard error.
\[SE = \sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})}{n}} = \sqrt{\frac{(0.205)(1-0.205)}{550}} = 0.0172 \]
Calculate the margin of error.
\[ME = z^\star SE = (2.05)(0.0172) = 0.0353 \] To find the confidence
interval's bounds, find the sample proportion plus or minus the margin
of error. \[p ~\approx~ \hat{p} \pm ME \] Determine the interval.
\[(0.17\,,~ 0.24) \] We are 96\% confident that the true population
proportion is between 17\% and 24\%.
\begin{answerlist}
  \item The lower bound = 0.17, which can also be expressed as 17\%.
  \item The upper bound = 0.24, which can also be expressed as 24\%.
\end{answerlist}
\end{solution}
