\begin{question}
Your boss wants to know what proportion of a very large population is
messy. She also wants to guarantee that the margin of error of a 99.5\%
confidence interval will be less than 0.008 (which is 0.8 percentage
points). How large of a sample is needed? Please round up, using only 2
significant digits.
\end{question}

\begin{solution}
Determine \(z^\star\) such that \(P(|Z|<z^\star) = 0.995\).
\[z^\star = 2.81\] Determine the maximal standard error.
\[ME = z^\star SE \]

\[SE = \frac{ME}{z^\star} = \frac{0.008}{2.81} = 0.00285 \] Calculate
\(n\). Because we have no idea what \(p\) is, we will use a conservative
approach and use \(p=0.5\). \[SE = \sqrt{\frac{p(1-p)}{n}}\]

\[n = \frac{p(1-p)}{SE^2} = \frac{(0.5)(0.5)}{(0.00285)^2} = 30778.7011388\]

When determining a necessary sample size, always round up (ceiling).
\[n = 30779 \] Also, for simplicity, you should probably only use about
2 significant digits, while still rounding up. \[n = 31000 \]
\end{solution}
