Question
========

A treatment group of size `r n1` has a mean of `r xbar1` and standard deviation of `r s1`. A control group of size `r n2` has a mean of `r xbar2` and standard deviation of `r s2`. If you decided to use a signficance level of `r alpha`, is there sufficient evidence to conclude the treatment causes an effect?

I've calculated (using the Welch-Satterthwaite equation) the degrees of freedom should be `r floor(df)`.
