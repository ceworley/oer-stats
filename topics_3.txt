Organize data using frequency distributions
histogram
    frequency
    relative frequency
    density
    percentile <--> score

read histogram
    how many values are between __ and __
    what fraction of values are between __ and __
    what cutoff value is the ___ percentile?

convert frequency to relative frequency
    r = f/n
convert frequency to density
    d = f/(n*w)
