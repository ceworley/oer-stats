\begin{question}
A random sample of size 1400 was found to have a sample proportion of
5.3\%. Determine a 80\% confidence interval of the population
proportion.
\begin{answerlist}
  \item Find the lower bound of the confidence interval.
  \item Find the upper bound of the condifence interval.
\end{answerlist}
\end{question}

\begin{solution}
Determine \(z^\star\) such that \(P(|Z|<z^\star) = 0.8\).
\[z^\star = 1.28 \] Calculate the standard error.
\[SE = \sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})}{n}} = \sqrt{\frac{(0.053)(1-0.053)}{1400}} = 0.00599 \]
Calculate the margin of error.
\[ME = z^\star SE = (1.28)(0.00599) = 0.00767 \] To find the confidence
interval's bounds, find the sample proportion plus or minus the margin
of error. \[p ~\approx~ \hat{p} \pm ME \] Determine the interval.
\[(0.0453\,,~ 0.0607) \] We are 80\% confident that the true population
proportion is between 4.53\% and 6.07\%.
\begin{answerlist}
  \item The lower bound = 0.0453, which can also be expressed as 4.53\%.
  \item The upper bound = 0.0607, which can also be expressed as 6.07\%.
\end{answerlist}
\end{solution}
