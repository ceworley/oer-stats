\begin{question}
A random sample of size 66000 was found to have a sample proportion of
6.4\%. Determine a 90\% confidence interval of the population
proportion.
\begin{answerlist}
  \item Find the lower bound of the confidence interval.
  \item Find the upper bound of the condifence interval.
\end{answerlist}
\end{question}

\begin{solution}
Determine \(z^\star\) such that \(P(|Z|<z^\star) = 0.9\).
\[z^\star = 1.64 \] Calculate the standard error.
\[SE = \sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})}{n}} = \sqrt{\frac{(0.064)(1-0.064)}{66000}} = 0.000953 \]
Calculate the margin of error.
\[ME = z^\star SE = (1.64)(0.000953) = 0.00156 \] To find the confidence
interval's bounds, find the sample proportion plus or minus the margin
of error. \[p ~\approx~ \hat{p} \pm ME \] Determine the interval.
\[(0.0624\,,~ 0.0656) \] We are 90\% confident that the true population
proportion is between 6.24\% and 6.56\%.
\begin{answerlist}
  \item The lower bound = 0.0624, which can also be expressed as 6.24\%.
  \item The upper bound = 0.0656, which can also be expressed as 6.56\%.
\end{answerlist}
\end{solution}
