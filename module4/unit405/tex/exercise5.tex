\begin{question}
If you suspect that \(\hat{p}\) will be near 0.76, how large of a sample
is needed to guarantee a margin of error less than 0.04 when building a
99\% confidence interval?
\end{question}

\begin{solution}
Determine \(z^\star\) such that \(P(|Z|<z^\star) = 0.99\).
\[z^\star = 2.58\] Determine the maximal standard error.
\[ME = z^\star SE \]

\[SE = \frac{ME}{z^\star} = \frac{0.04}{2.58} = 0.0155 \] Calculate
\(n\). Because we have no idea what \(p\) is, we will use a conservative
approach and use \(p=0.5\). \[SE = \sqrt{\frac{p(1-p)}{n}}\]

\[n = \frac{p(1-p)}{SE^2} = \frac{(0.76)(0.24)}{(0.0155)^2} = 759.2091571\]

When determining a necessary sample size, always round up (ceiling).
\[n = 760 \] Also, for simplicity, you should probably only use about 2
significant digits, while still rounding up. \[n = 760 \]
\end{solution}
