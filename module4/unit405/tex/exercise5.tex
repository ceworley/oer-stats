\begin{question}
If you suspect that \(\hat{p}\) will be near 0.33, how large of a sample
is needed to guarantee a margin of error less than 0.01 when building a
99.5\% confidence interval?
\end{question}

\begin{solution}
Determine \(z^\star\) such that \(P(|Z|<z^\star) = 0.995\).
\[z^\star = 2.81\] Determine the maximal standard error.
\[ME = z^\star SE \]

\[SE = \frac{ME}{z^\star} = \frac{0.01}{2.81} = 0.00356 \] Calculate
\(n\). Because we have no idea what \(p\) is, we will use a conservative
approach and use \(p=0.5\). \[SE = \sqrt{\frac{p(1-p)}{n}}\]

\[n = \frac{p(1-p)}{SE^2} = \frac{(0.33)(0.67)}{(0.00356)^2} = 17445.713925\]

When determining a necessary sample size, always round up (ceiling).
\[n = 17446 \] Also, for simplicity, you should probably only use about
2 significant digits, while still rounding up. \[n = 18000 \]
\end{solution}
