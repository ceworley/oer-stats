Question
========

In one sample of `r n1` cases, `r 100*phat1`% are `r adj` ($\hat{p}_1 = `r phat1`$). In a second sample of `r n2` cases, `r 100*phat2`% are `r adj` ($\hat{p}_2 = `r phat2`$). Determine a `r CL*100`% confidence interval of $p_2 - p_1$.

Answerlist
--------
* Determine the lower bound.
* Determine the upper bound.


Solution
========

Determine the point estimate of $p_2-p_1$ (our best guess for this population parameter is the corresponding sample statistic).
$$
\begin{aligned}
\hat{p}_2 - \hat{p}_1 &= `r phat2` - `r phat1` \\
 &= `r dphat`
\end{aligned}
$$
Determine the critical $z^\star$ value such that $P(|Z|<z^\star) = `r CL`$.
 $$z^\star = `r z`$$
Determine the standard error.
$$
\begin{aligned}
SE &= \sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}_1(1-\hat{p}_1)}{n_1}+\frac{\hat{p}_2(1-\hat{p}_2)}{n_2}} \\\\
&= \sqrt{\frac{(`r phat1`)(`r 1-phat1`)}{`r n1`}+\frac{(`r phat2`)(`r 1-phat2`)}{`r n2`}}\\\\
&= `r se`
\end{aligned}
$$
Determine the lower bound.
$$
\begin{aligned}
LB &= \text{point estimate} - ME \\
&= (\hat{p}_2 - \hat{p}_1) - z^\star SE \\
&= `r dphat` - (`r z`)(`r se`) \\
&= `r LB`
\end{aligned}
$$
Determine the upper bound.
$$
\begin{aligned}
UB &= \text{point estimate} + ME \\
&= (\hat{p}_2 - \hat{p}_1) + z^\star SE \\
&= `r dphat` + (`r z`)(`r se`) \\
&= `r UB`
\end{aligned}
$$
We are `r CL*100`% confident that $p_2-p_1$ is between `r LB` and `r UB`.

Answerlist
--------
* The lower bound = `r LB`
* The upper bound = `r UB`
