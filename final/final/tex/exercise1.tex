\begin{question}
In a deck of strange cards, there are 790 cards. Each card has an image
and a color. The amounts are shown in the table below.

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}lrrrr@{}}
\toprule
& gray & orange & pink & white\tabularnewline
\midrule
\endhead
bike & 54 & 45 & 85 & 77\tabularnewline
dog & 53 & 24 & 61 & 39\tabularnewline
horn & 16 & 72 & 55 & 56\tabularnewline
wheel & 23 & 73 & 31 & 26\tabularnewline
\bottomrule
\end{longtable}
\begin{answerlist}
  \item What is the probability a random card is both a horn and orange?
  \item What is the probability a random card is either a wheel or white (or
both)?
  \item What is the probability a random card is white?
  \item What is the probability a random card is a bike given it is orange?
  \item What is the probability a random card is a dog?
  \item What is the probability a random card is pink given it is a dog?
\end{answerlist}
\end{question}

\begin{solution}
\begin{answerlist}
  \item \(P(\text{horn and orange})\) \(=\frac{72}{790}=0.0911\)
  \item \(P(\text{wheel or white})\)
\(=\frac{23+73+31+26+77+39+56+26-26}{790}=0.411\)
  \item \(P(\text{white})\) \(=\frac{77+39+56+26}{790}=0.251\)
  \item \(P(\text{bike given orange})\) \(=\frac{45}{45+24+72+73}=0.21\)
  \item \(P(\text{dog})\) \(=\frac{53+24+61+39}{790}=0.224\)
  \item \(P(\text{pink given dog})\) \(=\frac{61}{53+24+61+39}=0.345\)
\end{answerlist}
\end{solution}
