p = round(runif(1,0.08,0.92),2)
n = sample(60:200, 1)
mu = n*p
sig = sqrt(n*p*(1-p))

Question
========

Let each trial have a chance of success $p=`r p`$. If `r n` trials occur, what is the probability of getting exactly `r k` successes?

In other words, let $X\sim \text{Bin}(n=`r n`,\,p=`r p`)$ and find $P(X = `r k`)$.


Solution
========

We use the formula for binomial probabilities.
$$P(X=k) = {n \choose k} (p)^{k}(1-p)^{n-k} $$
$$P(X=`r k`) = {`r n` \choose `r k`} (`r p`)^{`r k`}(1-`r p`)^{`r n`-`r k`} $$
$$P(X=`r k`) = {`r n` \choose `r k`} (`r p`)^{`r k`}(`r 1- p`)^{`r n-k`} $$

$$P(X=`r k`) = `r Pr`$$
